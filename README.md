# Linux Security Audit One-Click Script (Chinese Output Version)

## 📌 Project Introduction

This script is an **automated one-click Linux security inspection tool**, designed for incident response, security auditing, and emergency troubleshooting.  
Once executed, it automatically scans critical security aspects of the system, generates detailed logs, and optionally uploads them to a remote server.  
**All output messages are in Chinese**, making it easy to spot issues quickly during analysis.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Verify the integrity of critical binary files (Debian/RedHat compatible)
- ✅ Detect unusual open ports (help identify backdoors)
- ✅ Check abnormal startup items (systemctl, cron, rc.local, etc.)
- ✅ Detect hidden backdoor scripts and suspicious `.so` files
- ✅ Identify suspicious high-privilege processes
- ✅ Audit scheduled tasks (cron jobs)
- ✅ Review login history and potential privilege escalation traces
- ✅ Analyze suspicious accounts and SUID binaries
- ✅ Auto-generate comprehensive audit logs
- ✅ Support automatic remote log upload

---

## 🖥️ Supported Environments

- Compatible with: CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, Rocky, AlmaLinux, and most mainstream Linux distributions
- Required tools:
  - bash (default on Linux)
  - netstat or ss
  - lsof
  - base64
  - awk / grep / find

(The script intelligently adapts; missing tools will prompt appropriate messages.)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone or download the script

```bash
wget https://your-repo-url/security_audit.sh
chmod +x security_audit.sh
```

2. (Optional) Edit the **Remote Upload Settings**

Modify the following variables at the top of the script:

```bash
REMOTE_USER="user"    # your remote server username
REMOTE_HOST="host"    # your remote server IP or domain
REMOTE_PATH="/path/"  # your remote storage path
```

3. Run the script

```bash
sudo ./security_audit.sh
```

4. View the generated report

The log file will be saved in `/tmp/`, with the filename format:

```bash
/tmp/security_audit_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
```
